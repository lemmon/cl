# CL - Simple PHP Console Logger

A simple PHP console logger for local development and debugging, providing beautiful and detailed variable inspection. Particularly useful when working with PHP's built-in development server. During HTTP requests, dumps are automatically redirected to stdout, keeping your responses clean while still providing detailed debugging information.

## Why use CL?

*   **Clean HTTP Responses:** Unlike `var_dump()` or `print_r()`, `cl()` sends its output directly to your terminal (stdout), ensuring your browser's HTTP response remains clean and unaffected. This is invaluable when debugging APIs, JSON responses, or simply keeping your HTML output pristine.
*   **Detailed & Beautiful Output:** Leveraging Symfony's VarDumper component, `cl()` provides highly detailed, syntax-highlighted, and easily readable dumps of any PHP variable type, from simple strings to complex objects and arrays.
*   **Non-Blocking Execution:** `cl()` dumps the variable and allows your script to continue execution, unlike `dd()` (dump and die) functions that terminate the script immediately.
*   **Lightweight & Zero Configuration:** Just install and use. No complex setup or configuration files needed.
*   **Framework Agnostic:** Works in any PHP project, regardless of the framework you're using.

> [!NOTE]
> `cl` is a lightweight "dump-and-continue" helper for quick inspections, whereas Xdebug handles step-debugging, profiling, and coverageâ€”reach for the one that fits the task.

## Installation

```bash
composer require lemmon/cl --dev
```

> [!TIP]
> Install the package as a dev dependency (`composer require --dev`) so production builds stay lean.

## Usage

```php
<?php

require 'vendor/autoload.php';

// Dump any variable to console
$data = ['hello' => 'world'];
cl($data);

// Works with any PHP type
cl(new stdClass());
cl(42);
cl("Hello World");
```

> [!NOTE]
> The helper wraps Symfony's [VarDumper](https://symfony.com/doc/current/components/var_dumper.html), so any type VarDumper supports works automatically.

## Quick Example

Want to try it out? Clone this repository and run:

```bash
composer install
composer example
```

Then open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:8000. You'll see a simple message in your browser, but the real magic happens in your console where you'll see a beautifully formatted dump of various data types.

## Running Tests

Run `composer test` to execute the PHPUnit suite and confirm the helper remains functional.
